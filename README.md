## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to 2022 to better understand:

1. Which programming langauges are the most popular?
2. Which programming languages are increasing in popularity?
3. Knowledge of which programming langauges contributes to the highest average salaries? 
4. How are these average salaries changing over the last five years?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains a jupiter notebook pynb file that contains all of the code, as well as markdown cells used to organize sections of the code in regards to the above research questions. The data used in the notebooks could not be included due to large file sizes but can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kevinpolitz/which-programming-language-should-you-learn-907f26b9de8f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information like the survey itself and the results scehma at the link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
